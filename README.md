## [Mobiles Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC/SQL-Project)

In this project, I employed SQL and MySQL to manipulate a CSV dataset of mobile data sourced from a public community. The project encompassed several stages:

### Data Definition and Data Transformation:
Utilized **DROP** statements to eliminate extraneous records, streamlining the dataset for clarity and simplicity. Renamed columns for more intuitive access and manipulation through SQL queries.

### Data Manipulation:
Performed data cleansing to eradicate anomalies such as unwanted symbols and words, converting them into standardized data types. Additionally, introduced new columns to facilitate a more straightforward data comprehension.

### Data Filtering and Sorting:
Applied SQL clauses like **SELECT**, **WHERE**, **ORDER BY**, and **LIKE** to extract vital information, enabling analyses such as:
- Identifying highly-rated mobiles with substantial rating counts.
- Locating the most expensive Apple mobiles.
- Discovering mobiles with terabyte storage in black color.
- Searching for mobiles with dual front cameras.
- Filtering mobiles within the price range of ₹10,000 to ₹20,000.
