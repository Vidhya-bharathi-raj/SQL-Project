# SQL-Project

Mobiles data analysis using SQL

I extracted relevant information from a CSV file containing mobile data. I meticulously cleaned, reduced, transformed, and enriched the dataset. 
My primary focus was on crafting precise SQL queries, utilizing operators like `LIKE` and `WHERE`. These efforts culminated in valuable insights and findings. Overall, my project showcases my proficiency in data manipulation and SQL skills.
